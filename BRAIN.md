# PVTKRRX Brain

## Sports Posters Template Memory

- Canonical design source: `C:\Users\kepne\projects\L - PVTKRRX\PCnestspeaker\python-templates`.
- Do not invent a new poster style when working on Sports Posters. Copy/port the Python template geometry, hierarchy, and intent first.
- Active template family:
  - `01-editorial`
  - `02-broadcast`
  - `03-sportsbook`
  - `04-trading-card`
  - `05-brutalist`
  - `06-ticket-stub`
  - `07-glitch`
- `06-ticket-stub` is the free/default poster layout.
- Member Sports Posters can use all seven templates.
- Logo priority: SportsMeta/SportsDB league logo, home badge, and away badge first; sport-specific glyph fallback only when the DB image is missing.
- If a sport/league/team repeatedly falls back to glyphs, log it as DB enrichment work rather than redesigning the poster.
